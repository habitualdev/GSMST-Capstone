Brief
- Situation - Many companies and businesses have been compromised from supply chain poisoned software from Solarwinds
- Mission - At this time, it is neccesary to create an easy to deploy appliance to detect any indicators of Sunburst (the hack of Solarwinds)
- Execution - Using the provided dev space and VM's, create a small appliance that uses snort to detect network traffic indicative of Sunburst
- Administration - I am available for any questions and guidance on building this product
- Communication - Expect immediate feedback during the business day. Within a couple hours outside of that

Tools
 - snort
 - splunk
 - Splunk Universal Forwarder
 - Linux distro of choice (I reccomend centos)

 Timeline
 - Phase 1: Research and Understand. Know what snort is, and how its rules are written
    + A simple rule builder is call snorpy (https://github.com/chrisjd20/Snorpy)
    + Read documentation on how to install and configure snort (Focus on version 2.X. If you feel confident, use Snort3)
 - Phase 2: Initial Build
    + Choose your base operating system
    + Install and configure snort to detect traffic based on rules
 - Phase 3: Exporting Data
    + Using the Splunk universalforwarder, export data to a splunk index
    + Meaningfully display the data in a manner non-technical persons can understand
